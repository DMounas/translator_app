## üîë API Configuration

This app uses the Google Cloud Translation API, which requires a valid API key to function.

1.  **Get an API Key:**
    -   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    -   Create a new project and enable the **"Cloud Translation API"**.
    -   Ensure you have **Billing enabled** for the project (a free tier is available).
    -   Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" and create a new API key.

2.  **Add the Key to the Project:**
    -   In the `lib` folder, create a new folder named `api`.
    -   Inside the `api` folder, create a new file named `api_keys.dart`.
    -   Add your API key to this file like so:
        ```dart
        // lib/api/api_keys.dart
        const String googleApiKey = 'YOUR_REAL_API_KEY_GOES_HERE';
        ```

3.  **Secure Your Key (Crucial):**
    -   To prevent your secret API key from being exposed on GitHub, open the `.gitignore` file in the root of the project.
    -   Add the following line to the end of the file:
        ```
        # Secret API keys
        /lib/api/api_keys.dart
        ```
